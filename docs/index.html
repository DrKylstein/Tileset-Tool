		<h2 id="intro">Introduction to V2</h2>
		<a href="#top">Return to Top</a>
		<p>V2 is an extensive patch for Commander Keen in: Invasion of the Vorticons. It's features include:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>More tiles.</li>
			<li>A different set of tiles for every level.</li>
			<li>Sloped tiles.</li>
			<li>Custom 8-frame animations</li>
			<li>With an addon by Dr. Kylstein, a different palette for every level, and color cycling.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			In order to accomplish these things, tile editing for V2 is very different from the classic methods.
		</p>

		<h2 id="tilesets">What's in a Tileset?</h2>
		<a href="#top">Return to Top</a>
		<p>
			For convenience, V2 uses files with the ".tls" extension to bundle several different things
			that had previously been stored separately, as well as new data to support the new features.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Tile properties</dt>
			<dd>
				This is what the old TileInfo files contained, but more compact and with added data for slopes.
			</dd>
			<dt>Tile animations</dt>
			<dd>
				Unlike the old TileInfo, animations are stored as a table of eight frame indexes for each tile,
				allowing completely custom animation.
			</dd>
			<dt>Tile graphics</dt>
			<dd>
				This is what would have been in your 1TIL0001.BMP/2TIL0001.BMP/3TIL0001.BMP.
				Your graphics importer tool still decides how large this can be,
				but the actual graphics will be loaded from this part of the tileset file.
			</dd>
			<dt>Palette</dt>
			<dd>
				This is always included by Tileset Tool, but you will need Dr. Kylstein's V2 Palette Patch for the game to use it.
				It stores the colors to use with the tileset (sprites and menus will also use them, so be careful.).
				The addon patch will cause the colors to cycle through the first eight sets of sixteen colors at a regular rate,
				and to switch to the second eight when the lights are turned off.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			Tileset Tool has distinct sections for editing each of these,
			except for graphics, which must edited in a general graphics program and imported.
		</p>

		<h2 id="levels">Levels and TILEHEADs</h2>
		<a href="#top">Return to Top</a>
		<p>
			One of V2's flagship features is that you can use a different tileset with every level.
			Each level has the whole space allocated for tile graphics to itself, and its own animations and colors.
			Which tileset is used by which level is decided by an additional file,
			TILEHEAD.CK1 (or .CK2, or .CK3 as appropriate).
			Editing this file is beyond the scope of Tileset Tool, but a supplementary program, Tileset Manager,
			is available for that purpose.
			The file can also be generated from a command line by KeenGraph.
		</p>
		<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
		<dl>
			<dd>When I try to import my bmp tileset, all tiles show up as tile zero. Is this normal or am I doing something wrong?</dd>
			<dt>
				<p>
					The way the new tilesets work is that any tile can have any graphic assigned to it as part of
					the eight-frame custom animation that all tiles have.
					However, this does require each tile have its animation set.
				</p>
				<p>
					For tiles that you don't want to animate, a shortcut is provided:
					You can double-click on the tile to choose a graphic for all eight frames at once.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you really want to have a tile for every piece of your tile image,
					the option to "auto-map tiles" is available from the tools menu or toolbar.
					You can also do a partial mapping by setting the first tile,
					and then pressing "T" on every tile after it that you want mapped.
				</p>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				I apply "Four Frame Cycle" to the first animation frame but I have no idea what to do next.
				Only the first tile will animate when placed ingame, the rest are stationary.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Each tile has its own animation, so there's none of that strange linking that standard Keen: Vorticons likes to do.
				If you want to have all those variations, you'll have to set them up individually.
			</dt>
		</dl>

		<h2>Masked Tiles and Animations</h2>
			<p>
				A side benefit of the V2 animation system is that you don't have to include tile masks amongst your tiles.
				As long as the mask is in the right place in the image relative to the graphic it goes with, it will work.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another feature of the V2 animation system is that you don't have to include every frame of an animation amongst your tiles.
				As long as the frames are somewhere in the image, it can be part of a tile's animation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Used together, these features also enable animating masked tiles!
